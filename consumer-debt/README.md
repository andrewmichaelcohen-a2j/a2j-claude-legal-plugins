# Consumer Debt Plugin

Access-to-justice workflows for **consumer debt collection defense**.

When a consumer is sued by a debt buyer or original creditor, several common defenses may apply: the debt may be time-barred, the plaintiff may not be able to prove it owns the debt (chain of title), or the collector may have violated the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) or state consumer protection law. This plugin helps screen a matter for these issues.
